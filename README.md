# Why only 100 days of code

<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to the "Why only 100 days of code" repository!
This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress in solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on Leetcode and Github. 

As the name suggests, I have committed to a more than 100 days of coding challenge, where I aim to solve at least one DSA problem every day.

In this repository, you will find a detailed record of the DSA problems I have solved daily. Solution of every problem is documented in a separate file, along with the Problem Statement, Example Test Cases, Constraints, and the code solution with itâ€™s runtime.

My primary goal in maintaining this repository is to keep myself accountable and motivated throughout this coding challenge. Additionally, I hope that my progress can inspire other aspiring developers to take up similar challenges and improve their coding skills.

Feel free to explore this repository and provide feedback or suggestions. If you find any errors or have any questions, please feel free to raise an issue or reach out to me directly.

Thank you for visiting "Why only 100 days of code" repository, and I hope you find my progress inspiring!</p>
